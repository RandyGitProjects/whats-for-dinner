# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
* I was able to implement functionality that allows a user to click a radio button and display a dish idea to make for dinner. Also, I was able to create functionality that allowed the user to clear the dish idea they chose and pick another one.

### Installation Instructions:
* The person first has to find the repo RandyGitProjects/whats-for-dinner on       github.
* Above the list of files will be a green button called code with a dropdown menu.
* Copy down the repo of the URL using the SSH key and click the two little squares to  the right of the URL.
* Open your terminal and find the directory where you would like to clone down the repo.
* After the desired directory is found you want to type git clone and paste the URL you copied from github.
* Press enter to make a local copy clone and then you're done.

### Context:
* This project took approximately 19 hours to complete. This majority of the time was spent researching html, css, and working with the flexbox. I'm currently in week 3 of a 6 month intensive program through Turing School Software and Design

### Contributors:
* The main contributor to this application are:
* Randy Cisneros https://github.com/RandyGitProjects

### Learning Goals:
* My goal was to gain experience and utilize HTML, CSS and Javascript to mainuplate the page I was creating. 
* Another goal was to gain more experience and understanding of how to listen to and respond to user events. 

### Wins + Challenges:
* A win for this project was getting the buttons to work correctly using the event listeners.
* The biggest win and challenge was understanding where to put div's and images in the html. Also another big win was understanding that I need a .hidden class to display none inside the CSS. This drastically increased the functionality of the page itself.
